## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

If you want to update your schema and get the types with codegen, just create a new file in graphql/queries
like the other ones and do the query that you want to retrieve, done that you can just run:

```bash
npm run codegen
```

And your types will be ready to use

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
