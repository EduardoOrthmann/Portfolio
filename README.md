## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

If you want to update your schema and get the types with codegen, just create a new file in graphql/queries
like the other ones and do the query that you want to retrieve, done that you can just run:

```bash
npm run codegen
```

And your types will be ready to use.

When you are going to put your email on the .env constants do not forget that you can't put the password of your email 
you will  need to put the password generated by your google account. If you don't know how to get the password used from
the nodemailer follow these steps:

- Open your gmail
- Click in manage your google account
- Go to security
- Go down to app passwords
- Select other and give a name of your choice
- Click in generate and copy and paste the password in the .env constants

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
